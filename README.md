# Welcome to this project.
First of all I want to say that i do not own or have any rights within the Final Fantasy XIV D&D 5e edition homebrew, if you want to know more about follow the [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIVxDnD/)
All credits and all my thanks to [u/SilentSoren](https://www.reddit.com/user/SilentSoren/) for allowing me to bring the project to aurora builder.
Also ai do not own or have any rights within the [Aurora Builder](https://aurorabuilder.com/) i'm just a random dude bringing a homebrew that he loves so much.

All that aside lets go to the things about this:
Races:
at the moment (17/07) I implemented the following races: Au-ra, Elezen, Garlean, Hrothgar, Lalafell, Miqo'te,Roegadyn and Viera, and the languages: Auri, Garlean, Roegadyn and Viera.
The Hyur race I did not implemented yet because some problems with setting some racial features.
Races will come with time, since they're a lot bigger, and have more functions, it may take some time.

If you want to help in any way feel free to make a branch, fork, or submit an issue, thank yall!
