    <description>
      <p class="flavor">For centuries, our nation has been punished for the sins of our forefathers. If our punishment is to end, I believe we must right the wrongs of antiquity and move forward as a nation united. Needless to say, my father did not share this opinion.</p>
      <p class="indent">-Ser Aymeric de Borel, Lord Commander of the Holy See</p>
      <p class="indent">The Elezen are a race divided within themselves, and their often arrogant attitudes keep the other races at an arms reach. The Wildwood live off the lush forests, using their keen eyes to hunt and gather in the dense forests or live in the religious oligarchy of Ishgard, cut off from rest of the world. The Duskwights in contrast are notorious for thievery and pillaging. Spending much of their live in caves and caverns hidden in the forest.</p>
      <h4>Elegance and Pride</h4>
      <p class="indent">Long legs, slender bodies, pointed ears and sharp features are all marks of an Elezen. Only rivaling their otherworld appearance is the poise with which they carry themselves. Their tall, thin frames only differ within the race by the colour of their skin. All Elezen try to clothe themselves whenever it is appropriate, valuing their appearance</p>

      <h4>Difference of Opinion</h4>
      <p>The Elezen race is divided due to their pride. The Wildwood and Duskwights found they could not coexist and distanced themselves from one another. The Wildwood believing they are the true rulers of the forests in which they live and hold dominion. The largest population of Wildwood Elezen live in Ishgard, a massive religious city embroiled in a war against dragon kind, closed off from much of the world. The Duskwights, who made their homes in the cavern systems of the forests have since been driven to crime to survive due to the Wildwood's clutch on the boundaries of the forest.</p>

      <h4>The Woods and the North</h4>
      <p>The forest which the Elezen live is the Black Shroud, a massive forest brought to order by the Wildwood, who protect the forest from poachers and other threats which would encroach on it. Duskwights, who disregard the need to protect the forest and hunt to their content. Looking to the Northern city state of Ishgard, towering spires, homes and a grand cathedral hide behind their giant gates. Living conditions in Ishgard are rough, as the poor go hungry in the lower levels of the city, while the wealth live in exuberance, looking down on the less fortunate citizens, ruled by the religious teachings of the Holy See.</p>

      <h4>Honour and Vengeance</h4>
      <p>An Elezen may set out on an adventure for many different reasons. An Ishgardian Wildwood hungry for revenge against the dragons may set out to seek greater strength, while another may take up arms to defend their forest home from an encroaching threat against the Black Shroud. Duskwights may set out to gain honour and riches to support their family or to prove to the world they are more than just a thief. Perhaps you seek glory in battle, and head out to find this fame.</p>

      <h4>Elezen Names</h4>
      <p>Both the Wildwood and Duskwight clans of Elezen spell their names very similarly. Men's names are longer and always in -loix, -aux, -mont, or -geant. A female's name will always end in -ne, -ette, -elle, or -ie.</p>
      <p class = "indent"> the similarity in their first names, the Elezen tribes over time claimed sur names for either side. These surnames will never cross clans, but only those who live within the race will know the difference.</p>
