        <description>
            <p class="flavor">They sought to secure a place to breed and multiply, that their kind might survive. Self-preservation, as you say. But we have as much right to live and thrive as they. If our own survival is threatened, are we to lay down our arms and welcome oblivion? Nay.</p>
            <p class="indent">-Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn</p>
            <p class="indent">The Roegadyn are a physically powerful race of people with a thirst for life which few can rival. They live loudly with boisterous voices, larger than life goals and an unflinching approach to danger. Roegadyns are fearless explorers who long ago were the greatest pirates to sail the seas. Adventure is in their blood.</p>

            <h4>Size Matters</h4>
            <p>Roegadyn are enormous humanoids with a hulking muscular build. Men and women alike grow to tower over the other races. Partly due to their size, Roegadyn as a whole love competitions of strength and courage, challenging one another to push themselves and their bravery.</p>
            <p class="indent">Their faces have fierce features and large flat noses. Due to their large size, Roegadyn tend to wear durable, flexible clothing which allows them to move easily.</p>

            <h4>Maritime Reavers, Volcanic Hermits</h4>
            <p>The Sea Wolves live up to their names through a storied history on the ocean. Most Sea Wolf communities can be found on the coast, as most make their living from the sea.    </p>
            <p class="indent">Be it sailing, naval service or mercenary work, the Sea Wolves continue to feel most at home when adventuring on board a ship. The Hellsguard in comparison live in land around the volcanic mountains of Abalathia. Here they guard the material plane from undead spirits trying to return home.</p>

            <h4>The Great Seas and Abalathia</h4>
            <p>The Roegadyn as an entire race hail from the Northern seas , their name translating to people of the rain. These sea fairing people can be found living in coastal citites the world over living as sailors, mercenaries and pirates.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Hellsguard live around the volcanoes of the Abalathia mountains, believing their home to be a sacred place related to the afterlife. Those Hellsguard who choose to leave their mountain homes can be found in large cities near these mountains, making a living as sellswords or chasing deeper knowledge of magic.</p>

            <h4>In Their Nature</h4>
            <p>The Roegadyn people are a boisterous race, seeking out challenges to test their power and bravery. They rarely need much convincing to head into the heat of battle for a cause they believe in, though coin may help speed them along. Sea Wolves have a long history of pirating, looting and battle on ships of all sorts, giving them a deep seeded thirst for adventure. Hellsguard grow up in solitude away from society, having no city to call their own. They may decide to head off in search of a more engaging existence by heading down their mountain and seeing what else the world has to offer.</p>

            <h4>Roegadyn Names</h4>
            <p>Sea Wolves and Hellsguard follow very different rules when it comes to naming conventions. Sea Wolves all derive their names by combining two words from their ancient Roegadyn Language. Women of the Sea Wolves also derive their names by combining two words, but the second word is always one of eight words. Sea Wolves form their surnames by taking their parent's name and adding a third word; syn for males and wyn for females, indicating they are a son or daughter respectively.    </p>
            <p class="indent">Hellsguard on the other hand avoid their ancient language and use the common tongue. Their names are formed using two words as well, often drawing inspiration from nature. Women of the Hellsguard tend to use plant imagery in their names as well, but are not restricted to do so. Nearly all Hellsguard abandon their family names, refusing to be defined by their ancestors in the past.</p>
